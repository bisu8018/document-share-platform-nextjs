          <div>Data Controllers/Processors</div>
          Polaris Share provides services to customers who use these services to
          in turn support their own individual business functions. These Polaris
          Share owners / administrators create users for these services are
          considered data controllers for certain types of user data related to
          their respective vaults. Polaris Share is thus the processor for that
          data. Polaris Share customers (owners / administrators) share the
          responsibility for this category of data and are provided the tools to
          fulfill that obligation for their users who are eligible for the
          additional GDPR privacy rights.
          <br />
          Polaris Share customers share personal information with Polaris Share
          to establish and maintain services, and for this information Polaris
          Share is the Controller and is bound contractually as part of the
          contract for services.
          <br />
          Affiliated third party providers who in turn support the Polaris Share
          service also share responsibility as Processors and Sub-Processors in
          a similar manner.
          <br />
          All parties with support roles or access to applicable personal
          information within Polaris Share, are appropriately bound by contract
          to be compliant with the GDPR principles.
          <br />
          <div>Help for Admins / Owners with GDPR Compliance</div>
          GDPR compliance is a shared responsibility between Polaris Share
          customers (owners / administrators) and Polaris Share. Owners /
          administrators can request help from Polaris Share for complying with
          GDPR compliance, including support for users who wish to exercise any
          of their rights under the GDPR, by sending an email to
