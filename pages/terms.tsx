          <br />

          for all activities that occur under your Account and accept all risks

          <br />
          <br />
          7.3. You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing
          field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the
          development of quantum computers may present risks to the Services
          that you use and your Account, which could result in the theft or loss
          of your property. By using the Service or accessing Polaris Share
          Content, you acknowledge these inherent risks.
          <br />
          <div>8. The Services</div>
          8.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other
          things, provide software that facilitates the submission of DECK
          blockchain transaction data to the DECK blockchain without requiring
          you to access the DECK blockchain command line interface.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.2. No Password Retrieval. We do not receive or store your Account
          password or Private Keys. Your Private Key is your own and you are
          solely responsible for their safekeeping. We cannot assist you with
          Account password retrieval, reset, or recovery. You are solely
          responsible for remembering your Account password. If you have not
          safely stored a backup of any Account and password pairs maintained in
          your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any DECK you have
          associated with such Account will become permanently inaccessible if
          you do not have your Account password.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.3. Transactions. All proposed DECK blockchain transactions must be
          confirmed and recorded in the DECK blockchain via the Polaris Share
          distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer network), which is not
          owned, controlled, or operated by us. The DECK blockchain is operated
          by a decentralized network of independent third parties. We have no
          control over the DECK blockchain and therefore cannot and will not
          ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will
          be confirmed on the DECK blockchain.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.4. No Storage or Transmission of DECK. DECK, in any of its forms
          (DECK) is an intangible, digital asset controlled by you. These assets
          exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the DECK
          blockchain. The Service does not store, send, or receive DECK. Any
          transfer of title that might occur in any DECK, occurs on the DECK
          blockchain and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the
          Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any DECK.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.5. Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall
          create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy, or
          trusteeship, between you and us.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.6. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any
          information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You
          accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or
          omissions that you make in connection with any DECK blockchain
          transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype
          an Account name or otherwise provide incorrect information. We
          strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully
          before completing them via the Services.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.7. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have
          been submitted to the DECK blockchain via the Services, The Services
          cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction
          details. We have no control over the DECK blockchain and do not have
          the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.8. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes
          apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction
          details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and
          remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that
          the we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your
          DECK blockchain transactions or for collecting, reporting,
          withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any DECK blockchain
          transactions.
          <br />
          <div>9. Discontinuation of Services.</div>
          9.1. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or
          without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue,
          temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are
          solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of
          any Account and Private Key that you maintain in your Account.
          <br />
          <br />
          9.2. If you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of
          the Services, you will be may not be able to access DECK, DECK Dollars
          and DECK Power associated with any Account maintained in your Account

          all related information and files in such without cost to you,
          including, for instance, if you breach any term of this Agreement. In
          the event of termination, your access to the funds in your account
          will require you access to the DECK blockchain via the command line
          API or third party tool, and will require you to have access to your
          backup of your Account data including your Account and Private Keys.
          <br />
          <div>11. User Conduct</div>

          or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort (including,
          but not limited to, negligence) or otherwise, arising out of, or in
          any way connected with, the use of, or inability to use, the Service

          relating to the use of or inability to use of the Service
          <br />
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
          damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this
          Section may not apply to you.
          <br />
          <div>16. Modifications to the Service</div>
          We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
          permanently, the Service, or any features or portions of the Service,
          without prior notice. You agree that we will not be liable for any
          modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.
          <br />
          <div>17. Arbitration</div>
          Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
          arbitrate certain disputes with Polaris Share, Inc. and limits the way
          you can seek relief from DECOMPANY GLOBAL, Inc. If you do not agree
          with this Section 20, please discontinue using the Service.
          <br />
          <br />
          17.1. Binding Arbitration. Except for disputes in which either party
          seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks
          injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
          copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents,
          you and DECOMPANY GLOBAL, Inc.: (a) waive your right to have any and
          all disputes or Claims arising from this Agreement or DECOMPANY
          GLOBAL, Inc. (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in a court; and (b)
          waive your right to a jury trial. Instead, you and DECOMPANY GLOBAL,
          Inc. will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the
          referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing
          the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve
          it, instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in
          court).
          <br />
          <br />
          17.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.
          You agree that any dispute is personal to you and DECOMPANY GLOBAL,
          Inc. and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through
          individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration,
          class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither
          party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an
          individual makes and attempt to resolve a dispute as a representative
          of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and
          DECOMPANY GLOBAL, Inc. agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a
          class, or other type of representative action, whether within or
          outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group
          of individuals.
          <br />
          <br />
          17.3. Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that this Agreement affects
          interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 20
          shall be governed by, construed, and enforced, both substantively and
          procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.
          (the “FAA”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
          <br />
          <br />
          17.4. Process. You agree that you will notify us in writing of any
          Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties
          can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice
          to the us shall be provided by sending an email to
          <a href="mailto: connect@decompany.io">connect@decompany.io</a>
          . Your notice must include: (1) your name, postal address, and email
          address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and
          (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. If we cannot agree how
          to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the us receiving the
          notice, either you or Polaris Share, Inc. may, as appropriate pursuant
          to this Section 20, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim
          in court. You agree that any arbitration or claim against us must be
          commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose;
          otherwise, you agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means
          that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the
          Dispute). You have read, understand, and agree that: (a) any
          arbitration will occur in New York County, New York; (b) arbitration
          will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance
          with the rules of JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in New
          York will have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an
          arbitration award and over any Dispute between the parties that is not
          subject to arbitration. You may also litigate a Dispute in small
          claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute
          meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
          <br />
          <br />
          17.5. Authority of Arbitrator. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement
          and applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive
          authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive
          decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any
          remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may
          only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more
          than one individual’ s claims, preside over any type of class or
          representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving
          more than one individual.
          <br />
          <br />
          17.6. Rules of JAMS. The rules of, and additional information about,
          JAMS are available on the JAMS website at
          <a href="https://jamsadr.com">http://www.jamsadr.com/</a>
          , as may be updated from time to time. By agreeing to be bound by this
          Agreement, you either: (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read
          and understand the rules of JAMS; or (b) waive your opportunity to
          read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair
          or should not apply for any reason.
          <br />
          <br />
          17.7. Severability. If any term, clause, or provision of this Section
          20 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum
          extent required by law and all other terms, clauses or provisions will
          remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in
          Section 20.2 are severable from the other provisions of this Agreement
          and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by
          applicable law.
          <br />
          <div>18. Applicable Law and Venue</div>
          This Agreement and your access to and use of the Service and the
          Polaris Share Content will be governed by, and construed in accordance
          with, the laws of New York, without resort to its conflict of law
          provisions. To the extent the arbitration provision in Section 20 does
          not apply and the Dispute cannot be heard in small claims court, you
          agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of, or relating
          to, this Agreement shall be filed only in the state and federal courts
          located in New York County, New York and you hereby irrevocably and
          unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
          such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of this
          Agreement.
          <br />
          <div>19. Termination</div>
          We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to

          If any term, clause, or provision of this Agreement is deemed to be
          unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that term, clause
          or provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall
          not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
          provisions.
          <br />
